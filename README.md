# TodoList (React)! ðŸ˜ƒ

This Todo app allows users to add new todos through a form, view existing todos in a list, mark todos as complete or incomplete, and delete todos. Todos are updated in real-time when actions are performed (eg add, mark complete, or delete) by calling the API
to retrieve data and update the backend. The app is designed to be simple and user-friendly, with a responsive design that fits both large screens and mobile devices.
